Squalane Cleanser:
<br/>
A gentle cleansing product formulated to target makeup removal whilst leaving the skin feeling smooth and moisturized. The formula incorporates Squalane, alongside other lipophilic esters that are gentle, moisturizing, efficient in dissolving makeup and facial impurities and increasing the spreadability of the product. When rubbed between your palms for approximately 10-30 seconds, the product undergoes an important textural change from a balm-like consistency to a clear oil-like consistency. This allows the emulsifying sucrose esters in the formula to trap and blend the dissolved makeup and facial impurities with water for rinsing. Being non-comedogenic and soap-free, this formula is designed to be gentle enough for daily use, without over-drying the skin, making it suitable for all skin types.

Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG:
Caffeine Solution 5% + EGCG is a water-based eye serum that primarily targets visible skin concerns around the eye contour. This formula contains a high concentration of caffeine alongside Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside (EGCG) that is derived from green tea leaves. This combination of active ingredients work in synergy to reduce the appearance of visible dark circles and puffiness around the contour.
<br/>
Notes:

1. Hollowness in the eye contour as a result of the structure of sub-dermal tissues like fat and bone can result in visible shadows under the eyes. This shadow, which is not to be mistaken for dark circles, cannot be addressed with topical skincare including this formula.
<br/>
2. Fat deposits under the eye contour can create permanent puffiness in this area. This type of deposit cannot be improved with topical skincare, including this formula.
<br/>
3. Supplied in UV-protective packaging as EGCG is sensitive to light.
<br/>
Ethylated Ascorbic Acid 15% Solution:
Vitamin C is an effective, multifunctional antioxidant. It targets the appearance of uneven skin tone, dullness and signs of aging. This ethylated form is close in molecular weight to L-Ascorbic Acid, offering a direct-acting approach like L-Ascorbic Acid, to achieving a radiant and healthy-looking skin tone.

Topical Vitamin C offers a wide array of benefits to the skin. However, there are many derivatives of Vitamin C available commercially which can be potentially confusing for beginners. We have developed a guide that offers guidance on the formulations of Vitamin C and Vitamin C derivatives available under The Ordinary range. It also offers education on Vitamin C itself and on the differences between formulations of Vitamin C at large. Please click here for this guide.

Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution:<br/>
Glycolic Acid is an alpha hydroxy acid that exfoliates the skin. This 7% toning solution offers mild exfoliation for improved skin radiance and visible clarity, while also improving the appearance of skin texture with continued use.
<br/>
This formula contains a studied Tasmanian Pepperberry derivative to provide comforting benefits to the skin. It is further supported with the inclusion of ginseng root and aloe vera for both visible radiance and soothing benefits.
<br/>
The pH of this formula is approximately 3.6 and Glycolic Acid has a pKa of 3.6. The pKa is the most important aspect to consider when formulating with acids as it implies acid availability. When pKa is close to pH, there is an ideal balance between salt and acidity, maximizing the effectiveness of the acid and reducing the potential of developing irritation. Higher pH values in such a case would increase the concentration of salt, which counter-intuitively would make the formula even more irritating than if the formula was more acidic
